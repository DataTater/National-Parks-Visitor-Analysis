# National-Parks-Visitor-Analysis

In this project, I explored visitor data for various national parks in the U.S. using **R** and **ggplot2**.

## Key Insights:

- Created visualizations to show which parks attract the most visitors.
- Analyzed relationships between park size and visitor numbers.

### Tools Used:
- **R**
- **ggplot2**
- **tidyverse**
